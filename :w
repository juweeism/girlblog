hi

My wu tang name is in... from now on i shall be hailed as *Amateur Dominator*! If you think Childish Gambino is vogue you should also get your [wu tang name here](http://www.mess.be/inickgenwuname.php)!

### what i'm working on

[cornerboard](https://cornerboard.xyz) - An animal crossing townhall board rip off. Made by me and Giz. An evil force took down our self-hosted site which led us to rewrite it for Serverless deployment.

[archive.juw.ee](https://archive.juw.ee) - I am data hoarding digital trinkets and this place is where I will store them. Temporarily my out of context screenshot dump.  

**My personal professional (if you could call it that) website** is in the making. It takes time to get the vibe just right but i'm working double time to push it out soon. If it doesn't come out beautiful and eccentric, I don't want it.

### spooktober films 

🎞️ __The Substance (2014)__

> [Elisabeth Sparkle](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000193/?ref_=ttqu_qu): *You have to..*  
> [Sue](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4960279/?ref_=ttqu_qu): *CONTROL YOURSELF!*

- Satirical body horror without the satire. 

🎞️ __Corpse Bride (2005)__

> *"With this hand I will lift your sorrows. Your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine. With this candle, I will light your way in darkness. With this ring, I ask you to be mine"*

- I first saw this when I was little. Gothic horror and stop motion animation are two very important things to me. October is perfect timing to rewatch this as an adult so I did and it's just as good as I remember. 

This halloween I'm going to see Tremors, Gremlin and The Thing this halloween and Wicked in the next few weeks.
