Hi~ This month has been filled with lots of chess, crossing projects off of "ongoing" list, growing my music and film library, and making some horrible first attempts. 
### goings on

[cinerama.pages.dev](cinerama.pages.dev) - For regular cinema goers. I built a silly website that pulls movies currently screening and generates a calendar invite link for you. The theme was inspired from old theaters and drive ins. 
  
PERSONAL WEBSITE - I have won a battle against the inner critic and pushed out my personal website with a headline that reads like a reductress article.  

A WEBRING - This connect the dot spiral webring that's been sitting on my "ongoing" list.

MUSHROOM HOUSE - My proudest work yet. My humble mushroom home in minecraft. Built with blood, sweat, and tears!

### surfing the net

I spent an ample amount of time scanning digital newsletters and online magazines for their clean and sleek layouts, partly because i needed an inspiration for my personal portfolio. Announcing my top three favorites...

### post notes

Some things aren't worth sharing, especially the horrible first attempts. But since you're still here and I assume you enjoy reading, here are a few FYIs, 1) I DIYed my nail gel extensions. Not too bad for a first try... if only it wasn't too late for Nosferatu cosplay. 2) I was holding off the pole classes until I was fit enough but I finally bit the bullet and bought a class subscription.
