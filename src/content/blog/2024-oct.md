### tmil (this month i learned)

Gap Buffers / Playwright Tests / cloudflare functions / 

### what i'm working on

[cornerboard.xyz](https://cornerboard.xyz) - An animal crossing townhall board rip off. Made by me and Giz. Some evil force took down the self-hosted site (RIP) so we rebuilt the backend with cloudflare functions.

[archive.juw.ee](https://archive.juw.ee) - I am data hoarding and this place is where I will store the files. There is nothing much to see here for now. In the meantime, enjoy yourself with my out of context screenshot dump.

**My personal professional (if you could call it that) website** is in the making. It takes time to get the vibe just right but i'm working double time to push it out soon.  

### reading 

[I AM A FAN]() - A book I picked up months ago, finished recently. I AM A FAN OF SHEENA PATEL.

---

[BIG SWISS]() - Judging by it's cover and first few pages, I will read at least three chapters of it.

On another note, I've been playing [DENIM - WONSTEIN]() on repeat, vibing to an album with zero skips [CHROMAKOPIA - TYLER, THE CREATOR](https://open.spotify.com/album/0U28P0QVB1QRxpqp5IHOlH?si=VnIS9GDDQO29xUuvXpSbvQ), and debuting yet another playlist called [ORANGE](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/362HgaQ0wbGi9MXD3yuymT?si=311526c1cc6f4817).

Oh and PUNISHER - ETHEL CAIN, out November 1 btw!

### films

[THE SUBSTANCE 2024](https://boxd.it/zanS)
> Elisabeth Sparkle: *You have to..*  
> Sue: *CONTROL YOURSELF!*

- Satirical body horror without the satire. I will defend this movie with my entire life.  
  
[CORPSE BRIDE 2005](https://boxd.it/24WQ)
> *"With this hand I will lift your sorrows. Your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine. With this candle, I will light your way in darkness. With this ring, I ask you to be mine"*

- A movie I first saw when I was little. Gothic horror and stop motion animation are two very important things to me. October is perfect timing to rewatch this as an adult so I did and it's just as good as I remember.   
   
  
The theme for this Friday halloween is monster horror classics and I'm going to see Tremors, Gremlin and The Thing.

### post notes

My first entry of monthly notes. So I've begun taking notes of daily learnings and little details about my excessive media consumption. My chosen tool for this is none other than Google Keep...

Just so you know, I am a serial startist with a tendency to abandon projects halfway sooo fingers crossed I stick around for at least 3 more entries.
